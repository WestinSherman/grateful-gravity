Star Metal Dreams: Session 8

⸻

Chapter 1: Disorganized Plans

The group gathered around, trying to piece together their next steps. Notes were scattered, and memories jumbled. Somewhere, perhaps in an old Obsidian file, lay the detailed information they needed — but for now, they would have to rely on what they remembered.

Their ship was better equipped than they’d realized. Beyond the usual science facilities, they discovered specialized labs: pharmacology, xenology, xenotech, anthropology, and even a rare psionics lab. The pharmacology lab seemed newly added, its only blemish a faint bloodstain on the window desk, hastily cleaned by the maintenance robot.

Discussions shifted to science specialties, labs, and the strange chaos that seemed to follow every plan they made.

Chapter 2: Fragments of the Past

As the crew prepared for departure, memories of previous sessions and incidents floated to the surface. They discussed Marigold’s condition — physically fragile, mentally strained. Scans revealed minor brain irregularities, likely repairable with advanced tech or time and care.

Meanwhile, a lingering worry surfaced: a strange pharmacological company, TH LLEXA, connected to missing drugs and a dead man found with gunshots to the back of his head. Their trail led toward the Sword Worlds, to a planet called Enos — flagged with an amber warning. Danger lurked ahead.

Chapter 3: Gathering Resources

At the starport, the crew leveraged their newfound hero status. Drinks flowed freely, locals cheered, and everyone recognized them as saviors. Capitalizing on their fame, they recruited passengers for the journey and considered picking up cargo — anything to cover ship expenses.

Despite their popularity, a competent engineer proved elusive. Their virtual crew would have to suffice for now.

Meanwhile, a grim duty awaited: handling the bodies of fallen comrades, now occupying low berths. Respectfully, the team arranged for their official death records and made space for paying passengers.

Chapter 4: A Hidden Passenger

During preparations, a disturbing observation was made. One of the passengers, a supposed Varger (wolf-like alien), didn’t seem quite right. A glimpse beneath her fur hinted at an illusion — perhaps a human in disguise.

Caution took hold. Surveillance plans were quietly set in motion. Kevin, the small robotic companion, was tasked with monitoring her movements without tipping her off. Jennifer and the others prepared to watch and wait, gathering evidence before taking any action.

Chapter 5: Echoes in the Machine

Meanwhile, deeper mysteries stirred aboard the ship. Communication was established — not with a crew member, but with a consciousness hidden within the ship’s systems: an ancient intelligence, long dormant.

It spoke in fragments, unsure of its place in the modern world. Using old implants and half-forgotten technologies, it reached out to the crew, seeking survival, perhaps even friendship. The crew agreed — helping the ancient being could become a longer-term project.

Chapter 6: Departure

Preparations finished, the ship launched toward its jump point. Thirty-one hours of travel through the system lay ahead before they could safely enter jump space.

As the stars blurred past, tensions simmered beneath the surface. Their unknown passenger kept to her quarters, but suspicions only grew. With every hour, the journey toward Flamrian — and the uncertain future beyond — loomed larger.

The game was afoot, and the crew would need all their wits about them.
