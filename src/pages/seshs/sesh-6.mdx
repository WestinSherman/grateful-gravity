üöÄ Suspicion in the Skies

As the impersonator robot ‚Äî also known as the Pilot ‚Äî was taking off, something felt off with the ship‚Äôs propulsion system.

The Pilot asked, ‚ÄúDoes anyone here have engineering experience?‚Äù
No one responded.

He then turned to Cesar and asked if he could take over the controls while he went to the engineering room to make repairs. Cesar agreed and took command of the ship.

üîß Trouble in the Main Lab

While the rest of the crew waited on the bridge, Markev used Kevin (a device or companion) to scan for any kind of robotic workshop, hoping to uncover more about the Pilot‚Äôs true nature.

Kevin entered the Main Lab and spotted the Pilot in one of the lab rooms. He was rummaging through equipment and found a sealed jar. From his arm, the Pilot produced a cutting torch and began working on opening it.

Markev immediately shared this suspicious behavior with the rest of the crew.

‚ö° Confrontation

Jennifer, furious, stormed toward the Main Lab. She opened the door, saw the lab room open, walked in ‚Äî and slapped the Pilot across the face.

Startled, the Pilot bolted, heading toward the engineering room in an attempt to escape. Jennifer chased him down, tried to land a punch, but missed ‚Äî falling and hitting her head on a table.

As the Pilot neared the exit, Markev sprinted after him and tackled him to the ground. Kaz followed up with a solid punch to the Pilot‚Äôs face, breaking his nose.

Bleeding and desperate, the Pilot pleaded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you a lot of money ‚Äî just let me go!‚Äù
Kaz responded simply, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù, and kicked him in the face, knocking him unconscious.

‚∏ª

üß† What‚Äôs Inside the Arm?

Jennifer, still reeling, demanded Markev‚Äôs weapon so she could hack off the Pilot‚Äôs arm and see what he had stored inside. Markev refused, wanting to keep the Pilot intact.

Instead, Markev managed to open the arm without destroying it, uncovering its secrets.

üåã Volcano Rescue

With the Pilot subdued, the crew reached temporary safety and regrouped.

Knowing time was short, they decided to return and save the town from the erupting volcano. Despite the odds, they succeeded in rescuing the townspeople.

They were paid for their efforts ‚Äî and took off, leaving the chaos behind.

##### Original Verison:
We get to the top of the mountain. The ship is in the center of the lake.
As the inpersonator robot AKA(pilot) was taking off, there was a something slightly wrong with the propulsion of the ship.
The pilot says asks if anyone in the crew had any engineering experience to fix. Nobody did so the pilot asks Cesar if he 
and take over while he goes to the engineering room to fix the ship. Cesar says he can do it and takes over the controls. 
The pilot goes to the Main lab and starts working on the propulsion system. While everyone is waiting in the bridge,
Markev uses Kevin to look for any kind of robotic workshop that he could use to find out more about the pilot. As Markev goes
through the door to the Main lab, he sees the pilot in one of the lab rooms looking through everything,finds a jar,
and takes out a cutting torch out of his arm to open it. Markev shares this innformation with the rest of the crew.
Jennifer gets up and a feary and starts moving towards the Main lab. She opens the door and sees one of the lab doors open.
She goes and laps the pilot in the face. The pilot trys to run away and Jennifer chases him. The pilot runs towards the engineering room
trying to escape. Jennifer runs after him and tries to punch him but misses, falls over and hits her head on the table. The pilot is
moving towards the door while Markev is sprinting towards him and tackles him to the floor. Kaz punches him in the face breaking his nose.
The pilot says that he will give Kaz a bunch of money to let him. Kaz says no and kicks him in the face. The pilot is unconcious. 
Jennifer wants to take Markev weapon to hack of his arm to see what he put in it. Markev says no and Jennifer
because he wants to keep the pilot intact. Markev gets the arm open. We get to temperary safety and decide to go save everyone from the valcano.
We eventually do so, get paid, and head off.
